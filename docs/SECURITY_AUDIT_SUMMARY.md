# Security Audit Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the security vulnerabilities identified and fixed during the comprehensive security audit of the Spawn backend application.

## Vulnerabilities Identified and Fixed

### 1. Rate Limiting Implementation ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: No rate limiting on authentication endpoints, allowing potential brute force attacks.

**Risk Level**: HIGH
- Brute force attacks on login endpoints
- Account enumeration attacks
- Denial of service attacks

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added rate limiting using in-memory bucket approach
- Login endpoints: 5 attempts per minute per IP
- Sensitive endpoints (change password): 10 attempts per hour per IP
- Proper HTTP 429 responses with retry headers
- IP address extraction with X-Forwarded-For support

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/java/com/danielagapov/spawn/Config/RateLimitConfig.java` (NEW)
- `src/main/java/com/danielagapov/spawn/Config/RateLimitInterceptor.java` (NEW)
- `pom.xml` (dependency updates)

### 2. JWT Token Security ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Multiple JWT security vulnerabilities.

**Risk Level**: HIGH
- Algorithm confusion attacks
- Long refresh token expiry (180 days)
- Missing issuer/audience validation

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Reduced refresh token expiry from 180 days to 7 days
- Explicitly specified HS256 algorithm to prevent algorithm confusion attacks
- Added issuer validation ("spawn-backend")
- Added audience validation ("spawn-app")
- Enhanced token validation with multiple security checks
- Added proper error handling for JWT parsing

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/java/com/danielagapov/spawn/Services/JWT/JWTService.java`

### 3. File Upload Security ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Insufficient file upload validation and security controls.

**Risk Level**: HIGH
- Malicious file uploads
- Path traversal attacks
- File type spoofing
- Unlimited file sizes

**Solutions Implemented**:
- File size limit: 5MB maximum
- Content type validation (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP only)
- Magic number validation to prevent file type spoofing
- Malicious content signature detection (PHP, script tags)
- Filename sanitization to prevent path traversal
- Server-side encryption enabled (AES256)
- Enhanced error handling and logging

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/java/com/danielagapov/spawn/Services/S3/S3Service.java`

### 4. Admin Account Security ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Weak default admin password and insufficient password requirements.

**Risk Level**: HIGH
- Weak default password: "spawn-admin-secure-password"
- No password strength validation
- Potential unauthorized admin access

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Removed weak default password
- Require admin credentials to be set via environment variables
- Strong password validation (12+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars)
- Comprehensive logging for admin account creation
- Proper error handling for misconfigured credentials

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/java/com/danielagapov/spawn/Config/AdminUserInitializer.java`

### 5. Error Handling and Information Leakage ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Error messages potentially leaking sensitive information.

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- Stack traces exposed to clients
- Database error messages revealing schema information
- Inconsistent error response format

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Global exception handler with sanitized error messages
- Unique error IDs for debugging without exposing details
- Generic messages for authentication failures to prevent user enumeration
- Standardized error response format
- Proper logging with error correlation IDs
- Message sanitization for validation errors

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/java/com/danielagapov/spawn/Exceptions/GlobalExceptionHandler.java` (NEW)

### 6. Security Headers ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Missing security headers leaving application vulnerable to various attacks.

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- Clickjacking attacks
- MIME type sniffing vulnerabilities
- Missing security policy headers

**Solutions Implemented**:
- X-Frame-Options: DENY (prevent clickjacking)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff (prevent MIME type sniffing)
- Enhanced authentication error handling with security logging
- Client IP address tracking for security events

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/java/com/danielagapov/spawn/Config/SecurityConfig.java`

### 7. Input Validation and Sanitization ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Insufficient input validation allowing potential injection attacks.

**Risk Level**: HIGH
- SQL injection potential
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- Path traversal attacks
- Data corruption from invalid input

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Comprehensive input validation utility
- Pattern-based validation for usernames, emails, phone numbers, names
- Dangerous content detection (SQL injection, XSS, path traversal)
- Input sanitization methods
- Password strength validation
- UUID format validation
- Length validation utilities

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/java/com/danielagapov/spawn/Util/InputValidationUtil.java` (NEW)

### 8. CORS Configuration ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: CORS configuration allowing potentially unsafe origins in production.

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- Cross-origin attacks from unauthorized domains
- Development origins exposed in production

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Environment-based CORS configuration
- Production mode: Only allow specific trusted domains
- Development mode: Allow localhost and development domains
- Proper preflight caching (1 hour)
- Secure credential handling

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/java/com/danielagapov/spawn/Config/SecurityConfig.java`

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Input validation + output sanitization
- Authentication + authorization + rate limiting

### 2. Fail Secure
- Default deny for CORS origins
- Secure error handling that doesn't leak information
- Strong password requirements with no weak defaults

### 3. Least Privilege
- Minimal CORS origins in production
- Specific error messages only where safe
- Restricted file upload types and sizes

### 4. Security Logging
- Authentication failure logging with IP tracking
- File upload security event logging
- Admin account creation logging
- Error correlation with unique IDs

## Recommendations for Ongoing Security

### 1. Regular Security Reviews
- Conduct security audits quarterly
- Review dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Monitor security logs for suspicious activity

### 2. Security Monitoring
- Implement intrusion detection
- Set up alerts for multiple authentication failures
- Monitor file upload patterns for abuse

### 3. Additional Security Measures
- Consider implementing CAPTCHA for repeated login failures
- Add two-factor authentication for admin accounts
- Implement IP whitelisting for admin access
- Regular security scanning of uploaded files

### 4. Environment Security
- Ensure all production environment variables are properly secured
- Use secrets management for sensitive configuration
- Regular rotation of JWT signing secrets
- Monitor for unauthorized environment changes

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Security Testing
- Penetration testing for authentication bypasses
- File upload security testing with various malicious files
- Rate limiting effectiveness testing
- CORS policy testing from different origins

### 2. Automated Security Testing
- Static code analysis for security vulnerabilities
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Regular security regression testing

## Conclusion

This security audit identified and addressed 8 major security vulnerabilities ranging from high to medium risk. The implemented fixes provide comprehensive protection against common web application attacks including:

- Brute force attacks
- JWT manipulation
- File upload attacks
- Information disclosure
- Injection attacks
- Cross-origin attacks

The application now implements security best practices and provides a robust defense against common attack vectors. Regular security reviews and monitoring should be implemented to maintain this security posture.
