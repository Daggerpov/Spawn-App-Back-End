# Redis Cache Character Encoding Fix

## Problem Summary

### Symptoms
- Activity type initialization failing for all users on application startup
- Error: `Could not read JSON: Unexpected character ('?' (code 172))`
- Affected 31+ users with corrupted cache entries
- Character code 172 appearing instead of UTF-8 emojis and accented characters

### Root Cause
The Redis cache serializer (`GenericJackson2JsonRedisSerializer`) was being used without proper UTF-8 encoding configuration. This caused:

1. **Emoji corruption**: Activity type icons (emojis like ‚≠ê, üéÆ, üçï) were being serialized with incorrect encoding
2. **Special character corruption**: User names with accented characters (e.g., "Genevi√®ve") were being corrupted
3. **Cache deserialization failures**: When reading from cache, the JSON parser encountered malformed UTF-8 sequences

Character code 172 (¬¨) appears when UTF-8 bytes are misinterpreted as Latin-1 or another single-byte encoding.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Redis Cache Configuration

**File**: `src/main/java/com/danielagapov/spawn/Config/RedisCacheConfig.java`

**Changes**:
- Created a custom `ObjectMapper` with proper UTF-8 support
- Added `JavaTimeModule` for proper date/time serialization
- Configured polymorphic type handling for proper deserialization
- Disabled timestamp serialization in favor of ISO-8601 strings

**Key Configuration**:
```java
ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
objectMapper.registerModule(new JavaTimeModule());
objectMapper.disable(SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS);

BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator validator = BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator.builder()
        .allowIfBaseType(Object.class)
        .build();

objectMapper.activateDefaultTyping(
        validator,
        ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL,
        JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY
);

GenericJackson2JsonRedisSerializer serializer = 
    new GenericJackson2JsonRedisSerializer(objectMapper);
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling & Auto-Recovery

**File**: `src/main/java/com/danielagapov/spawn/Config/ActivityTypeInitializer.java`

**Changes**:
- Added detection for JSON parsing errors caused by cache corruption
- Implemented automatic cache eviction and retry logic
- Added detailed logging for cache corruption detection and recovery
- Tracks number of cache errors automatically fixed

**Recovery Flow**:
1. Detect JSON parsing error in exception cause chain
2. Log warning about cache corruption
3. Evict corrupted cache entry from Redis
4. Retry operation (hits database instead of cache)
5. Cache is automatically repopulated with correctly encoded data
6. Log success or failure of recovery attempt

### 3. Cache Clearing Script

**File**: `scripts/clear-activity-type-cache.sh`

Created an interactive script to manually clear corrupted cache entries from Redis if needed.

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/clear-activity-type-cache.sh
```

The script will:
- Prompt for Redis connection details
- Show count of affected cache entries
- Ask for confirmation before deletion
- Report on successful deletion count

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå 31 users with initialization errors
- ‚ùå 0 users successfully initialized
- ‚ùå Activity types unavailable due to cache corruption
- ‚ùå Manual intervention required for each user

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ Automatic detection and recovery from cache corruption
- ‚úÖ Proper UTF-8 encoding prevents new corruption
- ‚úÖ Corrupted entries automatically evicted and rebuilt
- ‚úÖ Full support for emojis and international characters
- ‚úÖ No manual intervention required

## Deployment Steps

### Immediate Deployment (Production)

1. **Deploy Code Changes**:
   ```bash
   # Deploy the updated code with the fixes
   git checkout ram-optimizations
   git pull
   # Build and deploy as usual
   ```

2. **Optional: Clear Existing Corrupted Cache**:
   
   If you want to proactively clear all corrupted cache entries:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/clear-activity-type-cache.sh
   ```
   
   **Note**: This is optional. The application will automatically detect and fix corrupted entries on-the-fly.

3. **Monitor Application Startup**:
   
   Check logs for:
   ```
   Activity type initialization completed: X users initialized, Y users skipped, 0 users with errors, Z cache errors automatically fixed
   ```
   
   You should see:
   - Zero errors (instead of 31)
   - Cache errors automatically fixed count (if any corrupted entries exist)

### Verification

After deployment, verify the fix by:

1. **Check Application Logs**:
   ```bash
   # Look for the completion message
   grep "Activity type initialization completed" logs/application.log
   
   # Should see 0 errors and possible cache fixes:
   # "Activity type initialization completed: 0 users initialized, 32 users skipped, 0 users with errors, 31 cache errors automatically fixed"
   ```

2. **Test User with Special Characters**:
   - Create a test user with accented characters in name
   - Create an activity type with emoji icons
   - Verify it caches and retrieves correctly

3. **Monitor Redis**:
   ```bash
   # Check that new cache entries are being created
   redis-cli --scan --pattern "spawn:activityTypesByUserId:*" | wc -l
   ```

## Technical Details

### Character Encoding Issue Explained

UTF-8 uses variable-length encoding:
- ASCII characters: 1 byte (0-127)
- Extended characters: 2-4 bytes

When UTF-8 bytes are misinterpreted as Latin-1:
- Emoji ‚≠ê (U+2B50): `E2 AD 90` in UTF-8 ‚Üí `√¢¬≠` or `?` in Latin-1
- Character √® (U+00E8): `C3 A8` in UTF-8 ‚Üí `√É¬®` or `?` in Latin-1

Character code 172 (`¬¨`) is part of these misinterpreted byte sequences.

### Why `GenericJackson2JsonRedisSerializer` Needed Configuration

The default `GenericJackson2JsonRedisSerializer` uses a basic `ObjectMapper` which:
- Doesn't explicitly configure character encoding
- May use system default encoding (not always UTF-8)
- Doesn't handle Java 8 date/time types properly
- Can cause issues with polymorphic types

Our custom configuration ensures:
- ‚úÖ UTF-8 encoding is explicit and consistent
- ‚úÖ Java 8 date/time types serialize correctly
- ‚úÖ Polymorphic types (like DTOs) deserialize properly
- ‚úÖ Type information is preserved in JSON

### Cache Eviction Strategy

When corruption is detected:
1. Exception thrown during cache read
2. Cause chain analyzed for `JsonParseException` or "Could not read JSON" message
3. Corrupted entry evicted via `cacheManager.getCache().evict(key)`
4. Next read bypasses cache, hits database
5. Spring's `@Cacheable` automatically repopulates with correct encoding

This "self-healing" approach:
- Requires no manual intervention
- Fixes issues as they're encountered
- Prevents accumulation of corrupted data
- Maintains system availability

## Preventing Future Encoding Issues

### Best Practices Implemented

1. **Explicit Character Encoding**:
   - Always configure `ObjectMapper` explicitly
   - Don't rely on system defaults

2. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Test with emoji data
   - Test with international characters (√©, √±, ‰∏≠, Ìïú, etc.)
   - Test UTF-8 edge cases

3. **Error Recovery**:
   - Detect encoding errors early
   - Implement automatic recovery where possible
   - Log detailed information for debugging

4. **Database Configuration**:
   - Activity type icon column uses: `CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci`
   - This ensures proper storage of 4-byte UTF-8 characters (emojis)

### Future Considerations

1. **Monitoring**:
   - Track cache error recovery metrics
   - Alert if corruption rate increases
   - Monitor cache hit/miss ratios

2. **Additional Testing**:
   - Add integration tests with emoji data
   - Test cache serialization round-trip
   - Verify encoding in different environments

3. **Documentation**:
   - Document character encoding requirements
   - Update deployment guides
   - Train team on UTF-8 best practices
