## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive in-house analytics system for the Spawn app, designed to track user behavior, app performance, and business metrics while maintaining full data ownership and privacy control.

### Key Objectives
- **User Behavior Analytics**: Track user journeys, feature adoption, and engagement patterns
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor app performance, API response times, and error rates
- **Business Intelligence**: Measure key metrics like retention, growth, and feature usage
- **Real-time Insights**: Enable real-time dashboards and alerting
- **Privacy First**: Maintain full control over user data and comply with privacy regulations

### Recommended Solution
A **zero-cost database-driven architecture** with optional real-time capabilities, built entirely using existing infrastructure: PostgreSQL, Spring Boot, Redis (if available), and custom dashboards.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Analytics Infrastructure
The Spawn app currently has minimal analytics capabilities:

1. **Search Analytics Service** (`SearchAnalyticsService.java`)
   - Tracks fuzzy search performance and patterns
   - In-memory storage with configurable analytics
   - Limited to search-specific metrics

2. **Application Logging**
   - Standard Spring Boot logging
   - User action logging scattered throughout services
   - No centralized event tracking

3. **Notification System**
   - Event-driven notifications for user actions
   - Could be extended for analytics event tracking

### Current App Features Requiring Analytics
Based on codebase analysis, key trackable features include:

#### User Lifecycle
- **Authentication Flow**: Registration, login, OAuth flows
