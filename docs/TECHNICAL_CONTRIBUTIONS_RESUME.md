# Technical Contributions Resume Bullet Points

## Spawn (Co-Founder & CTO) - Spring Boot Backend

### Architecture & Clean Code

- **Architected scalable REST API backend** in Spring Boot following clean code principles, implementing layered architecture with 295+ Java files totaling **32k+ LOC** across Controllers, Services, DTOs, and Repositories

- **Designed microservice-style domain separation** with 25+ business domains including Activity Management, User Authentication, Friend Requests, Chat Messaging, and Analytics, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability

- **Implemented comprehensive dependency injection** using Spring's IoC container with interface-based service abstractions, enabling testability and loose coupling across 20+ service layers

- **Engineered thread-safe OAuth authentication system** with concurrency controls using `ConcurrentHashMap` locks and `@Transactional(isolation = SERIALIZABLE)` to prevent race conditions during user registration and sign-in flows

### API Development & Performance Optimization

- **Built 100+ REST endpoints** across 20+ controllers with comprehensive error handling, input validation, and standardized HTTP status code responses following RESTful best practices

- **Optimized database performance by 73%** (547ms→148ms average response time) through Redis caching implementation for 19+ critical queries and N+1 query elimination using batch processing

- **Implemented comprehensive caching strategy** with Redis covering activity feeds, user data, friend requests, and location data, with configurable TTL and cache invalidation patterns

- **Designed efficient database schema** with 20+ JPA entities, composite keys, and optimized relationships, using Flyway migrations for schema versioning and constraint management

### Security & Authentication

- **Implemented secure JWT-based authentication** with refresh token rotation, bcrypt password hashing, and role-based access control protecting 80+ secured endpoints

- **Integrated Google & Apple OAuth 2.0 flows** with strategy pattern implementation, token verification, and graceful error handling for external authentication providers

- **Developed IP-based rate limiting system** with thread-safe request tracking for DDoS protection and API abuse prevention

- **Configured comprehensive CORS policies** and Spring Security with method-level security annotations, securing cross-origin requests and protecting sensitive endpoints

### Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Established comprehensive testing suite** with 350+ unit and integration tests achieving significant code coverage using JUnit 5, Mockito, and Spring Boot Test

- **Implemented parallel test execution** with Maven Surefire plugin configuration for 4-thread concurrent testing, reducing test suite execution time

- **Created dedicated test configurations** with H2 in-memory database for isolated testing environments and proper test data management

- **Developed performance testing framework** for critical business logic including activity type management and friendship operations

### Infrastructure & DevOps

- **Configured production-ready application** with environment-specific properties for dev/test/prod deployments, external configuration management, and secret handling

- **Implemented comprehensive logging strategy** with custom error handling, structured logging, and application monitoring throughout all service layers

- **Designed database migration strategy** using Flyway with baseline migration support, enabling safe schema evolution in production environments

- **Integrated AWS services** including S3 for file storage with CloudFront CDN, and prepared infrastructure for EC2 deployment

### Advanced Features & Analytics

- **Developed fuzzy search functionality** using Jaro-Winkler similarity algorithm with configurable thresholds and optimized performance for user discovery

- **Built real-time push notification system** supporting both APNS (iOS) and FCM (Android) with event-driven architecture using Spring's application events

- **Implemented comprehensive analytics tracking** system for 8+ KPIs including user engagement, feature adoption, and performance metrics with privacy-first data collection

- **Created automated background services** for data cleanup, share link management, and cache invalidation using Spring's `@Scheduled` annotations

### Data Management & Business Logic

- **Engineered complex relationship management** including friendship systems, activity participation tracking, and user blocking with proper cascade delete operations

- **Implemented sophisticated feed algorithms** combining user-owned activities and invited activities with personalized filtering and performance optimization

- **Developed location-based services** with geographical data handling, proximity calculations, and location privacy controls

- **Created comprehensive email notification system** with HTML templating, verification workflows, and responsive email design using Thymeleaf

### Code Quality & Maintenance

- **Established clean code practices** with consistent naming conventions, comprehensive documentation, and adherence to SOLID principles throughout the codebase

- **Implemented custom exception hierarchy** with typed exceptions for different error scenarios and centralized error response handling

- **Utilized modern Java features** including Optional handling, Stream API for data processing, and Lambda expressions for functional programming approaches

- **Integrated Lombok** for boilerplate code reduction while maintaining readability and following builder patterns for complex object construction
