Models, otherwise called "entities," are the classes that represent the database tables. They're what are retrieved and put into the database. 

In the Swift side, I've defined these entities (of which, we won't use `AppUser` in the back-end, as that's just for the mobile side). FriendTag has been replaced by the Friendship model.
