-- V8_1__Remove_Phone_Data_Modification.sql
-- This migration removes the problematic approach of modifying phone number data
-- and replaces it with application-level flexible matching

-- We're no longer modifying stored phone number data to avoid:
-- 1. Unreliable +1 country code assumptions
-- 2. Data loss from overly aggressive cleaning
-- 3. Incorrect assumptions about user locations

-- Instead, the application now uses PhoneNumberMatchingUtil for flexible matching
-- This allows us to:
-- 1. Match phone numbers in various formats without data modification
-- 2. Support international numbers without country code assumptions
-- 3. Preserve original user data as entered

-- Log this change for tracking
